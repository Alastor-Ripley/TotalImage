HP 9121 DISK FORMAT (264 KiB)

A very early 3.5" format used by HP for their 9121 disk drives. These were used by their 150 Touchscreen computer, among others. The drives and media are single-sided (SS) double-density (DD). Also commonly known as "270k", and rarely as "280k". The information below has been obtained by observing original disk images.

These disks have 70 tracks, of which only 66 are used. There is also a sector interleave of 1:4, so the logical sector order in a track looks like this:

0  4  8  12  1  5  9  13  2  6  10  14  3  7  11  15

First three bytes in observed images are EB 1C 90, followed by OEM ID 48 50 31 35 30 20 20 20 ("HP150   ", see notes). A standard DOS 2.0 BIOS parameter block follows with the following values:

Bytes per sector: 256
Sectors per cluster: 4
Reserved sectors: 2
Number of FATs: 2
Root directory entries: 128
Total sectors: 1056
Media descriptor: 0xFA (BPB) or 0xFF (FAT) (see notes)
Sectors per FAT: 3
Sectors per track: 16 (BPB) or 17 (Teledisk) (see notes)
Number of heads: 2 (see notes)

Raw image size is 270336 bytes.

NOTES:
-Observed Teledisk images have sector IDs starting from 0 instead of 1 as usual.
-MS-DOS for the HP 150 may depend on the mentioned OEM ID to recognize disks, but this has not been confirmed.
-BPB values may not be entirely reliable on such disks. Number of heads (sides) is reported as 2 instead of 1, and media descriptor (0xFA) does not match the one in the FAT (0xFF).
-Teledisk's track headers reports 17 sectors per track, DOS BPB reports 16. Raw image size and other parameters support the latter number, with the 17th sector likely being unused.
