TRIUMPH-ADLER ALPHATRONIC PC-16 FORMAT (400 KiB)

A rare 5.25" format used by the Triumph-Adler Alphatronic PC-16. The drives and media are double-sided (DS) double-density (DD) with 40 tracks.

First three bytes in observed images are EB 4A 90, followed by OEM ID 54 41 42 54 58 50 43 30 ("TABTXPC0"). A standard DOS 2.0 BIOS parameter block follows with the following values:

Bytes per sector: 1024
Sectors per cluster: 2
Reserved sectors: 1
Number of FATs: 2
Root directory entries: 128
Total sectors: 400
Media descriptor: 0x00 (BPB) or 0xFF (FAT) (see notes)
Sectors per FAT: 1
Sectors per track: 5
Number of heads: 2

Raw image size is 409600 bytes.

NOTES:
-Media descriptor (0x00) in the BPB does not match the one in the FAT (0xFF). The BPB value should probably be ignored.
