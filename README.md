# TotalImage
**TotalImage** is a free and open source floppy disk, hard disk and optical disc image editor licensed under the MIT license. For more information, see the `LICENSE` file.

## Features
The goal of TotalImage is to be a better alternative to some of the more widely used disk image tools of today. This means it needs to:
* be completely free and open-source
* be updated and improved regularly, as much as personal circumstances of the developers permit
* support a wide range of disk image containers, physical disk formats and file systems
* handle and report exceptions properly
* offer other related advanced features that might come in handy

Because TotalImage is still under development, not all of the above can be achieved immediately. However, support for the following is planned:

### Disk image containers
* Raw sector images (.IMG, .IMA etc.)
* Anex86 (.FDI, .HDI)
* DiskDupe (.DDI)
* TeleDisk (.TD0)
* ImageDisk (.IMD)
* CopyQM (.CQM)
* EZ-DisKlone Plus (.FDF)
* 86F (.86F)
* Virtual Hard Disk (.VHD)
* ISO (.ISO)
* And more

### Physical disk formats
* Standard PC-compatible 5.25" and 3.5" formats (160/180/320/360/640/720/1200/1440/1680/1722/2880k)
* 8" formats, such as 1232k
* Formats with sector sizes other than 512 bytes
* IBM XDF variants
* DEC RX50 400k
* And more

### File systems
* FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32
* HPFS
* NTFS
* ISO9660
* UDF
* And more

### Partitioning schemes
* MBR variants
* GPT

Please note that these lists are not exhaustive nor definitive. We're open to adding support for more stuff in the future, but we have to start with the basics.

## System requirements
* Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or later
* [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) or [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) runtime

Support for other operating systems will be considered within the limitations of .NET.
